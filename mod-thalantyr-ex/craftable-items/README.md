## Items
### Shandalar's Cloak
I wanted to use the lore from Shandalar and source books, and I thought that in the off chance that a PC manages to defeat Shandalar, it would be a fun reward to give the player a cloak that they can use that looks and behaves kind of like Shandalar. For References to Shandalar, see: [Shandalar on the Forgottem Realms wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shandalar). Note: Shandalar has two publications according to the wiki: Baldur's Gate and [Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Volo%27s_Guide_to_the_Sword_Coast).

##### Statistics
Cloak is a +2 protection cloak (+2 AC, +2 saving throws) which also grants 50% electrical resistance and 25% fire resistance.

##### Creation
Consumes shandalar's cloak and wardstone; requires 3 protection scrolls from electricity, 2 protection scrolls from fire, and 10,000 gp.



### Varscona +3
Varscona is a _very_ decent sword in BG, probably _the_ capstone longsword for base BG1. That said, swords especially into SoD need to go into the +3 realm, and I want to allow the PC to take this beauty all the way to ToB. I'll have more mods for item import later.

##### Statistics
Varscona +3 deals 1d8+3 slashing, 2d3 cold; with a +3 enchantment and thac0 bonus. It grants 10% fire resistance and offers a 5% chance to drain 1 HP on hit.

##### Creation
Upgrades the +2 longsword to +3; requires 1 emerald, 1 Cone of Cold scroll, 1 Vampiric Touch scroll, and 6,000 gp.



### Koveras' Ring of Protection
Ever since I "authored" the BGT mod, I felt this pull towards Koveras' ring of protection. It felt like an item that should have a story to itself, not just a basic clone of a +1 Ring of Protection. It felt like an item that you should be able to keep as a trophy, a momento or other and I always felt it was bogus that this never had anything done with it, but the _golden pantaloons_ did have a C-plot. After checking Github for this item in the BGT repo (not there), and my HDDs from 20-ish years ago (still there), I wanted to put it back in.

This component has two sub-components; both will replace the Ring of Princes flavor text with a description matching in-game events. 
One will have Koveras offer you a cursed ring, the other will leave the interaction as-is. Both paths will have an upgrade to the +2 ring of protection.

#### +1 Ring
Both sub-components will update the flavor text to deviate from ring of the prices to reflect its history in-game.

##### Statistics
The +1 ring is updated to also grant +5 hp and 5% magic resistance.

#### Component: Koveras' Cursed Ring
Fairly simple: turn the ring Koveras gives you into a cursed ring. It makes sense from a story and RP perspective. If you then un-curse it, it becomes the ring of protection +1 described above. This component mentions on the +1 ring that Thalantyr un-cursed the item.

##### Restoration
Requires three scrolls of Remove Curse; 2 potions of fortitute; 3 garnets; and 3,000 gold

#### Component: No Cursed Ring
Also fairly simple: the ring that Koveras gives you is not cursed, and can be upgraded straight to a +2 version, with its own flavor text.

#### +2 Ring
Regardless of how you get the +1 ring, it can be boosted to +2.

##### Statistics
The +2 ring grants +2 AC and +2 to saving throws as well as +5 hp, 10% Magic Resistance, and immunity to instant death effects.

##### Creation
The +2 ring requires 1x pearl; 1 scroll of Protection from magic, 3x scroll of raise dead; 5,000 gp. Should be 4x Death ward scroll, but doesn't exist in BG1.

#### Versions
| Name                                 | Effects                                                                          |

### Amulet of Protection +2
Similar to the merging of two rings of protection, this will take two amulets of protection and merge them into a +2 amulet.

##### Creation

### Cloak of Protection +2
Similar to the merging of two rings of protection, this will take two cloaks of protection and merge them into a +2 cloak.

##### Creation
The amulet will require the golden axe +1; a diamond; a scroll of Dispel Magic; plus 3,000 gold.


### Axe +1 Wizard Slayer

Found in Durlag's Tower, this axe would be further improvable.
+2 basic stats, +3 vs mages (mages, sorcerers, and elminster).

## Dedication
This mod is dedicated to Elliana. I was mid-playthrough of BG:EE when she was born. I started this
mod right after she was born, in the few wee hours when I had precious few moments not rocking her
to sleep, feeding her, or when her mom wasn't asking me to wash bottles. Mostly between the hours
of 10 PM and 2 AM, my solo watch as kiddo slept. I love you, pumpkin.
